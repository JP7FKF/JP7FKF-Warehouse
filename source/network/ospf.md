## [OSPF attribute  Further information](https://www.forwardingflows.net/troubleshooting-ospf-neighbor-mismatch-effectively-junos/)
- Unique router-id
- Area ID
- Area flags (Stub/NSSA flag)
- Authentication type (MD5 (type 2), Simple (type 1) or None (type 0))
- Authentication password (The authentication secret)
- Hello/Dead interval
- L3 MTU (The MTU announced on OSPF DBD packets)
  - Compatible network type (p2p, broadcastetc... The network type must be consistent on the network segment. You’d have a broken graph if one OSPF node is expecting to   - have a DR and other OSPF nodes aren’t.)
- Network Mask (Since the network mask is coupled with the underlying graph, it has to match.)
